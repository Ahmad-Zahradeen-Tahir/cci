The final codebase must be clean, scalable, readable, and heavily commented for learning and future maintenance, including file header comments for every component, inline comments explaining state, props, event handlers, layout logic, and major JSX sections, with beginner-friendly variable names and modular folder structure.

Apply a clean NGO/healthcare design system with primary color #1E88E5, accent color #EC407A, white/light grey backgrounds, rounded cards, soft shadows, full responsiveness, sticky top navigation with Home, About, Programs, Impact, Get Involved, Donate (as a highlighted CTA), and Contact, including a mobile hamburger menu with animation.
